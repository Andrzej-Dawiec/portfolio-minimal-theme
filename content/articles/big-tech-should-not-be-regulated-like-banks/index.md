# Introduction

Big tech companies should not be regulated like big banks, since this would hurt the industry more than help users. Tech companies operate in completely different profit margins and theories. When it comes to big tech companies, they are operating to serve new products that often need to move quickly when it comes to deploying and shipping new products (Constable, 2018). However, for banks, they are dealing with more fiscal and economic factors that is based on safer and more niche fields. To push regulation on tech companies, they should be regulated differently, and ensured that they are still able to create innovation and competition (Constable, 2018).

This ultimately would stifle innovation and history has shown that governments failed to regulate these companies properly (Denning, 2020). While the monopoly that is currently forming in big tech companies is concerning, we still have innovative features that are released every day through other companies that disrupt the market (Denning, 2020). If we start implementing restrictive regulation, then everyone would follow suit and it would cement these large corporations as the primary heads of technology.

# Big tech companies should regulate themselves

Throughout the past decade, many of the groundbreaking problems that had risen in the field has been regulated based on other private companies competing to make their products better (Denning, 2020). This is evident in the cybersecurity space, where we have seen massive improvements in system hardening with cryptography and bot prevention (Huddleston, 2020). This was implemented to protect individuals’ privacy and the security of their product, which became the new standard (Zingales, 2018).

When it comes to understanding security and the field of engineering, the fast-paced nature of everything often trickles down into the norm (Waters, 2021). Even if the company that created a useful tool, all the other companies will adopt those better practices, thus regulating everything for the better. The tech industry will always be ahead of the government, and if we allow them to regulate like they have for banks, they would ultimately leave the field in disarray (Quest & Charrie, 2019).

# Regulation would bring out negative side affects when it comes to a free market

Steve Jobs is a prime example of developing new tools that would often get criticised for being weird, however, they were way ahead of their times (Huddleston, 2020). If the US government set the regulation standard of a specific floppy disk port back in 1984, there would be an adverse affect on how quickly our transfer speeds were (Huddleston, 2020).

This would ultimately had a negative point of view when it came to innovating internal and external buses, as they would have had to adhere to a worse form of port (Josaphine, 2022). For this reason, not only would our future be slower to adopt new and innovative technologies, but if we regulate tech companies like banks, we are missing out on years of growth and knowledge (Huddleston, 2020).

# Government regulators are often incompetent

Not only does the tech industry encompass hundreds of roles and moving parts, but it also is naturally faster and more flexible than banking (Constable, 2018). Most “expert” regulators get hired by the regulated (Constable, 2018). These “regulators” are often hired by the largest organizations that can afford to pay off their regulators, and have them target smaller competitors (Constable, 2018).


This ultimately shows the incompetence of the United States government, and this allows the power vaccum to increase.
