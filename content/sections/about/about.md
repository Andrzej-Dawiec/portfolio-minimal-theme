Ethan Yee is a 4th year Applied Computing (Computer Science) major at the University of Washington. He is currently on the Data Science track.

I have previous experience using React.js, Next.js, Python, Flask, Django, and other frameworks. I was previously an intern at Apple, Microsoft, Paypal and Google, and I am currently looking for Web developer roles.

Outside of the tech industry, I am passionate about film making and photography. I am currently filming a short film about identity and origins.

Feel free to reach out to me!
