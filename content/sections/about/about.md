---

Andrzej Dawiec is currently a 3rd year Computer Science & Software Engineering major at the University of Washington Bothell. 

I have previous experience in Java, C++, Objective-C and Python along with other frameworks. I am the CEO and founder of 90Degree Studios and I am currently looking for Software Developement Internships. 


Outside of the tech industry, I am passionate about cars, 3D-modeling/printing along with photography. I love the outdoors and mountain biking with friends.  

Fun fact about me - I was born in Krak√≥w, Poland and moved to the United States at age 7! I am bilingual and speak English and Polish natively. 

Feel free to reach out to me!
