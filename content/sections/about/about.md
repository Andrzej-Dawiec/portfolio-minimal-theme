---

Andrzej Dawiec is a recent graduate from the University of Washington Bothell with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Software Engineering. 

I have previous experience in Java, C++, Objective-C and Python along with other frameworks. I am currently seeking full-time software engineering opportunities that align with my passions and strengthen my skills. Feel free to connect with me and if you have an opportunity you’d like to discuss, feel free to reach out to me at contact@andrzejdawiec.info


Outside of the tech industry, I am passionate about cars, 3D-modeling/printing along with photography. I love the outdoors and mountain biking with friends.  

Fun fact about me - I was born in Kraków, Poland and moved to the United States at age 7! I am bilingual and speak English and Polish natively. 

Feel free to reach out to me!
